It is primarily aimed at estimating the levels of employment and unemployment in the Philippines. One of the objectives of the LFS is to provide a quantitative framework for planning and policy-making affecting the labor market. The survey is designed to generate statistics on the levels and trends of employment, unemployment, and underemployment of the country, both nationally and regionally, covering all 17 administrative regions."

This sample size is considered sufficient to provide precise and reliable estimates at both national and regional levels. The survey's reporting unit is the household, meaning the collected statistics pertain to the characteristics of individuals residing in private households.
